The topic of final qualifying work: ''Comparison of point cloud attribute compression methods''.

This Bachelor's work describes the development of the new approach for
comparison of different point cloud attribute compression methods. In this
paper, the analysis of existing point cloud compression quality assessment
systems carried out. Also, the suite of metrics for point cloud attribute
compression is defined. As a result of existing approaches analysis, the suite
of requirements for new point cloud compression quality assessment system is
defined.

In the course of work, the software for evaluating point cloud compression
qualitative metrics developed in Python programming language. The proposed
approach was integrated withing PCCArena - point cloud compression benchmark.
Using modified version of PCCArena, qualitative comparative analysis of Draco
and TMC13 codecs carried out.
